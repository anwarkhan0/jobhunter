This repository contains both the backend and frontend of a web application. The backend is built with **Node.js** and the frontend is built with **React.js**.

## Folder Structure

* **/backend**: Contains the Node.js application and related files.
* **/frontend**: Contains the React.js application and related files.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or higher)
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repository-name.git
   cd repository-name
   ```

2. Install backend dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   # or if using yarn
   yarn install
   ```

3. Install frontend dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   # or if using yarn
   yarn install
   ```

### Running the Application

1. Start the backend server:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm start
   # or if using yarn
   yarn start
   ```

2. Start the frontend development server:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm start
   # or if using yarn
   yarn start
   ```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to view the React app and `http://localhost:5000` (or the port set in the backend) to interact with the Node.js API.

## Environment Variables

You can set the following environment variables for both the frontend and backend:

* **Backend**: Create a `.env` file in the `/backend` folder.
* **Frontend**: Create a `.env` file in the `/frontend` folder.

Refer to `.env.example` files for variable examples (if available).
